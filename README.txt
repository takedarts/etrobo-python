Python middleware for ET-ROBOCON 2023.

This is a python middleware to develop embedded programs to control robots at
ET-ROBOCON 2023 which is a embedded software contest in Japan. Using this
middleware, developers can write python programs that run both in robots
(ev3dev/raspike) and simulators. See the following GitHub repository, if you
would like to know more about this middleware (This repository supports only
Japanese, and does not have a plan to support English).
